# About the theme and concept
- Everyone loves neat, yet black, abstract, neon style themes. A place where you can feel yourself safe and calm. This theme offers exactly those things. A wonderful and nice enviroment to give everyone a good vibe. 
Enaught spiritual talking. Even tho this project is just a theme, I do put effort and love into this. I would like to let everyone know that the theme is still under developement and if there's any issues or bugs, everyone can contact me over on discord. Discord: nyvw#6415.

- When Discord announces a new update, I will update the project as soon as possible. The idea is that I highly proritize and pay attention to discord updates because I want to have happy users with the new discord changelogs. Everyone that uses the theme needs to be happy.
